Project Title: Illuminating Plant-Archaea Interactions to Regulate Nitrogen Availability in Soils and Increase Carbon Capture

Project Descripton: Use controlled laboratory ecosystems, synthetic biology and metabolomics to identify mechanisms of plant-archaea interactions.

R code for data analysis of three sets of experiments:
1) Switchgrass + Ammonia Oxidizing Archaea (AOA) in ecoFABs
2) Switchgrass exudates + AOA
3) Metabolites identified in Switchgrass exudates + AOA
