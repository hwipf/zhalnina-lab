Project Title: Chemoecological Characterization of Plant-Archaea Interactions Reveals Linkages Between Metabolite Diversity, Transcription, Nitrogen Cycling, and Mixotrophy

Project Descripton: Utilization of controlled laboratory ecosystems, biochemical assays, metabolomics, and transcriptomics to identify mechanisms of plant-archaea interactions.

R code for data analysis of two sets of experiments:
1) Switchgrass + Ammonia Oxidizing Archaea (AOA) in ecoFABs
2) Metabolites identified in Switchgrass exudates + AOA
